                                    BUG REPORT #1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:           Adventurer Card Failing to Discard After Being Played
Product:         dominion.c
Classification:  Serious bug in regards to game mechanics
Platform:        FLIP 
Reproducibility: Every Time

Description:
------------------- 
When running cardtest2.c, the purpose of which is to test the functionality of the 
Adventurer card, it is apparent that the number of discarded cards is one less than 
the expected value. This is reinforced when running randomtestadventurer.c, which 
shows one extra card in the players hand after playing adventurer (indicating one 
card hasn’t been discarded). Since the non-treasure cards are all accounted for in 
the discard pile, and the count is always off by one card, it is believed that the 
missing card from the discard pile is the Adventurer card itself. 

Steps to Reproduce:
-------------------
For unit testing, stack a deck with known values and compare the discard count before 
and after playing the Adventurer card. Compare the expected discard count to the actual 
discard count. This is the process used when running “make unittestresults.out”.

For random testing, check the players hand before and after playing adventurer for 
randomly generated decks. Their hand count should increase by 2, and those two cards 
should be treasure cards. Compare the expected hand count and hand contents before and 
after playing Adventurer to identify any issues. This is the process used when running 
“make randomtestresults.out”. 

Expected Results:
-------------------
1) Hand count should increase by 1 (2 cards drawn, Adventurer discarded) when running 
both randomtestadventurer.c and cardtest2.c.

2) Discard pile should increase by 4 in all cases of cardtest2.c.

Actual Results:
-------------------
1) Hand count increased by 2 in all 10,000 iterations of randomtestadventurer.c and 
all cases of cardtest2.c.

2) Discard pile increased by 3 in all unit tests of cardtest2.c.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title:           Incorrect Player Score with scoreFor() Function
Product:         dominion.c
Classification:  Serious bug in regards to game mechanics
Platform:        FLIP
Reproducibility: Every Time

Description: 
-------------------
When running unittest4.c, the purpose of which is to test the functionality of the 
scoreFor() function, it is apparent there are two issues: The score for the Gardens 
card is not being calculated correctly the score from the players deck is incorrect 
in most cases. Lines 433, 444 and 455 use the card code 0 when counting Gardens in 
a player’s deck, however this is actually the card code for Curse cards. Also, in 
line 448, the for-loop only iterates up to the size of the discard pile rather than 
the deck pile. This would cause the score from deck to be incorrect when the deck 
and discard piles differ in size. 

Steps to Reproduce:
-------------------
The method used in unittest4.c is to stack the players deck, hand and discard pile 
with known cards and then compare the actual score with the expected score. When 
placing only Gardens into the player’s piles, it should be apparent that the score 
is always 0 (no matter the number of Gardens used). When calculating the score from 
the player’s deck, it should be apparent that the actual value differs from the 
expected value whenever the deck and discard piles have a different size. 

Expected Results:
-------------------
In the file unittestresults.out (see attachment below), we should see passing results 
for the score from hand, score from deck, score from discard and score from hand, deck 
and discard combined. This is indicative of an accurate score count for the player. 

Actual Results:
-------------------
In unittestresults.out (see attachment below), we see failing results for the Gardens 
card in all cases. The score from deck is incorrect for all cards, which then causes 
the combined score to be incorrect for all cards.
